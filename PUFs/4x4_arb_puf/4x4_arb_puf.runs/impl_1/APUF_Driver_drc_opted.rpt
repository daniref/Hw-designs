2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
NSTD-1#1 Critical Warning
Unspecified I/O Standard  
34 out of 34 logical ports use I/O standard (IOSTANDARD) value 'DEFAULT', instead of a user assigned specific value. This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all I/O standards. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified I/O standard value defined. To allow bitstream creation with unspecified I/O standard values (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks NSTD-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run. Problem ports: challenge[24:0], clk, enable, ready, response[5:0].
Related violations: <none>

UCIO-1#1 Critical Warning
Unconstrained Logical Port  
34 out of 34 logical ports have no user assigned specific location constraint (LOC). This may cause I/O contention or incompatibility with the board power or connectivity affecting performance, signal integrity or in extreme cases cause damage to the device or the components to which it is connected. To correct this violation, specify all pin locations. This design will fail to generate a bitstream unless all logical ports have a user specified site LOC constraint defined.  To allow bitstream creation with unspecified pin locations (not recommended), use this command: set_property SEVERITY {Warning} [get_drc_checks UCIO-1].  NOTE: When using the Vivado Runs infrastructure (e.g. launch_runs Tcl command), add this command to a .tcl file and add that file as a pre-hook for write_bitstream step for the implementation run.  Problem ports: challenge[24:0], clk, enable, ready, response[5:0].
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[1].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[1].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0/O, cell APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[1].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[2].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[2].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0/O, cell APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[2].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[3].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[3].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0/O, cell APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[3].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[1].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 1 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
APUF_TEST_UNIT/APUF_ARBITER/FF_2_1/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[2].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
APUF_TEST_UNIT/APUF_ARBITER/FF_3_1/Q_reg
APUF_TEST_UNIT/APUF_ARBITER/FF_3_2/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#3 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT APUF_TEST_UNIT/SWITCH_BLOCKS[4].SWITCH_BLOCK/EQUAL_PATHS[3].EQUAL_PATH_MUX/Q_INST_0 is driving clock pin of 3 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
APUF_TEST_UNIT/APUF_ARBITER/FF_4_1/Q_reg,
APUF_TEST_UNIT/APUF_ARBITER/FF_4_2/Q_reg
APUF_TEST_UNIT/APUF_ARBITER/FF_4_3/Q_reg
Related violations: <none>
